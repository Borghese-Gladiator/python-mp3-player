# python-mp3-player
Wrote a basic MP3 player using tkinter for GUI & pygame to manage audio commands.

## Steps
- Initially followed tutorial here: [https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-an-mp3-music-player-with-python-619e0c0dcee2](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-an-mp3-music-player-with-python-619e0c0dcee2)
- Used next tutorial to fix tkiner code here and change it to a class: [https://pythonbasics.org/tkinter-listbox/](https://pythonbasics.org/tkinter-listbox/)
- Then, fixed audio command code from first one to match Python class
- Lastly, created an MSI executable based on following code: [https://pythonprogramming.net/converting-tkinter-to-exe-with-cx-freeze/](https://pythonprogramming.net/converting-tkinter-to-exe-with-cx-freeze/)
- created installer with command `python setup.py bdist_msi` (only works on Windows)
